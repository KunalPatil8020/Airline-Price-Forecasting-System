# Flight Price Prediction Project

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of an airline ticket based on historical data. By understanding the relationships between various features and flight prices, the model can help in anticipating price trends and making data-driven decisions.


The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, named "Flight Price Prediction." It contains information about flights, including:
- Airline
- Source City
- Destination City
- Departure and Arrival Times
- Duration
- Number of Stops
- Class (Economy/Business)
- Days Left until the flight
- Price
